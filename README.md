## Model Context Protocol (MCP) Course Directory Overview

This document gives you a chapter-by-chapter map of the **MCP-A2A Udemy** repository.  
Each folder focuses on one key concept or tool in the Model Context Protocol ecosystem.

### Directories

**01_FirstMCPServer** ðŸ’¡  
Setting up and running your first basic server that implements the Model Context Protocol.

**02_TransportMethods**  
Exploring different transport methods â€” `SSE` (Server-Sent Events), `streamable-http` (stateless vs. stateful), and `stdio` â€” for MCP communication.

**03_RessourcesPromptsTools**  
Defining and managing resources, prompts, and tools within the MCP framework.

**04_Context**  
Deep dive into the powerful `Context` object of the FastMCP package.

**05_Discovery**  
Dynamically updating clients when a server adds, updates, or removes tools.

**06_Roots**  
Understanding *roots* in MCP: boundaries that tell servers where they may operate and how clients can announce relevant resources.

**07_Sampling**  
Letting servers request LLM completions through the client. Techniques for sampling context, selecting tools, and managing information flow.

**08_LangGraph_MCP**  
Integrating MCP with **LangGraph** to connect an MCP Server to a modern LLM.

**09_Authorization**  
Securing MCP services through proper authorization mechanisms. This chapter demonstrates how to implement the OAuth 2.1 workflow using **Auth0** as the identity provider.

**10_Fastapi_Integration**  
More on embedding MCP servers into the **FastAPI** ecosystem to create robust, production-ready services.

**11_Composition**  
Strategies for composing multiple, independent MCP services into one cohesive system.

**12_Proxy_Servers**  
Proxies that bridge legacy SSE traffic to the new *streamable-http* method, while routing and enhancing requests.

**13_Capstone**  
A full-stack, Docker-based AI web application (frontend + API server + MCP server) that ties together everything youâ€™ve learned.

**14_A2A** ðŸš§  
*Under construction â€“ stay tuned!*
